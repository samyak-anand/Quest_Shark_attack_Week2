# 🦈 Shark Attacks Data Wrangling & Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project focused on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation from shark attack incidents around the world. The notebook titled `2025-04-17-updated-Data-Wrangling-Sharks-Ana.ipynb` presents the workflow and findings in a structured, reproducible manner.

## 📚 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to clean, standardize, and explore a dataset detailing global shark attacks. The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful patterns, addressing missing data, and visualizing trends over time, location, and victim attributes.

This project is part of **Unit 2: Data Wrangling & Retrieval**, aimed at building foundational skills in working with messy real-world data using **Python** and **pandas**.

## 📁 Files Included

- `2025-04-17-updated-Data-Wrangling-Sharks-Ana.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the data wrangling pipeline and EDA.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and summary.
- (Optional) `sharks.csv`: The original dataset if included separately.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling of null values, inconsistent formatting, and irrelevant columns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of clean and consistent columns such as `Year`, `Country`, `Activity`, `Fatal (Y/N)`, and `Gender`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations highlighting patterns in shark attacks by year, country, activity type, and fatality.
- **Insights**:
  - Temporal trends in shark attacks
  - High-risk locations and activities
  - Demographic breakdowns (age, gender, etc.)

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Bar charts of shark attacks by country
- Time series of attacks over decades
- Pie charts showing fatal vs non-fatal incidents

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shark-attacks-analysis.git
   cd shark-attacks-analysis
